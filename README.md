# Customer Churn Prediction for Telecommunications Company

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. Understanding churn behavior is crucial for retention strategies, allowing the company to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Solutions Implemented

### Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and converting data types, such as making `TotalCharges` numeric.
- Removed irrelevant features, including `customerID`, and performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.

### Feature Engineering
- Standardized numerical features (`tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`) using `StandardScaler` to ensure equal contribution of all features to distance calculations.
- Created polynomial features to explore interactions between variables.

### Model Selection and Training
- Implemented various classification algorithms, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (via `GridSearchCV`) to optimize model performance, focusing on Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models using metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and AUC-ROC score to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and overall effectiveness in predicting churn.
- Reported the best parameters found through grid search, demonstrating a systematic approach to optimization.

## Impact
- **Enhanced Customer Retention:** By accurately predicting churn, the telecommunications company can implement targeted retention strategies, reducing churn rates and improving customer lifetime value.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The insights gained from the analysis will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about marketing, customer service, and product offerings tailored to retain at-risk customers.
- **Scalability:** The model can be refined and scaled to include additional data or new features, allowing the company to adapt to changing customer behaviors over time.
- **Cost Savings:** Reducing churn directly impacts revenue. By retaining more customers, the company can save on acquisition costs associated with bringing in new customers to replace those lost to churn.

This project provides a robust framework for understanding and addressing customer churn in the telecommunications industry, ultimately contributing to improved business outcomes.
